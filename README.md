Project Title: AI-Driven Customer Segmentation Based on Purchase Patterns

Goals:

- Construct a dependable classification system.
- Process and examine purchase history data.
- Attain high accuracy through rigorous evaluation and optimization.

Data Source:

- Employ a dataset from retail transactions, capturing customer purchase histories, transaction specifics, product categories, and spending amounts.

Approach:

1. Data Preparation:
   - Gather, review, and sanitize the dataset.
   - Address missing data, transform categorical variables, and normalize numerical features.

2. Feature Development:
   - Derive insights like purchase frequency, average expenditure, and product affinities.
   - Implement clustering techniques or RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis.

3. Model Construction:
   - Implement machine learning models (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Neural Networks).
   - Divide data into training and validation subsets.
   - Train models and assess their performance.

4. Assessment and Refinement:
   - Evaluate using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Adjust hyperparameters for improved outcomes.

5. Implementation:
   - Save and deploy the model for customer segmentation and marketing initiatives.

Tools and Technologies:

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow/Keras
- Platforms: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab
- Version Control: Git, GitHub

Challenges and Resolutions:

- Data Integrity: Ensure cleanliness to manage gaps and inconsistencies.
- Feature Selection: Use expert insights and statistical analysis.
- Model Efficacy: Optimize hyperparameters and employ ensemble techniques.

Results:

- Precise customer classification.
- Strategic insights for targeted marketing.
- Enhanced strategies for customerÂ segmentation.
